Dynatrace Kt-
1)a very good monitoring tool front end,backend and database.
2)it is not possible to monitor n number of microservices at once ,so we use dynatrace.
3)how the dynatrace work is,it sets up an agent in your infrastructure and that agent keeps on monitoring that application.
4)Davis AI,sits on your application and checks how your application is peforming,cpu,RAm,load.
it monitors for long time and it observes when to raise alerts,when not to raise.
5)if something unusual happens like(response time increased or any error).it raise alert.


Difference between kibana and Dynatrace.
1)Kibana works on elastic search 
2)basically kibana checks on the application logs and dynatrace checks the infa.
3)Dynatrace is like a dashboard where we can have all things like cpu,memory,db.we can configure whatever we want in a single place.
4)Dynatrace have multiple features not all have the permission to do it.
5)Settings-->Alerting-->Problem Alerting profiles.we might set  n number of alerts on the infrastructure.as per our needs.
6)we can set alerts via other methods but that we need admin access.if you don't know how to use other teams will get alerts,that's issue.
7)Dashboard is a form of data explorer.
