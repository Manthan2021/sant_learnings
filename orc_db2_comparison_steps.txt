1)Go to source table(DB2) and Oracle tables
2)verify the columns of both the tables are same or not,then you need to compare data type then you need to compare nullabilty column
3)Indexes column name for DB2 table and Indexes column namefor Oracle tables should match.
4)Kafka Insert Time ,Kafka Update would not be available DB2 tables it must be there in oracle only.
5)Contcur Column needs to be identified,check with naresh.

Offset table check the columns of the offset.
6)check column name and data type must be same in offset table.
7)after checking the columns ,come to indexes
8)OffsetmetadataId should be unique,so it contains unique index name whereas other columns(enivornment,consumergroup,topic name,partition_Id) may or maynot
 constitute same index name.
9)indexname must be same and verify it first in PRE then in Dev.
10)offset table index you must verify it with any existing offset table.
11)main table you need to compare with DB2.


**I am comparing offset table with another offset table
in offset I compared-
column,datatype in offset as well as Indexname and column name in the indexes.

**while comparing indexes of the main table keep in mind
1)it must have equal number of unique sets,and equal number of indexes and columns
2)we compare indexes on the base of column names

size of datatype must be compared for DB2 and oracle,ignoring Date and timestamp
char/varchar same for DB2 oracle and numeric/decimal also same.

we have a link strm..topic_name-key in which we get all keys
and for strm..topic_name-value we check all columns are there in a table or not.
